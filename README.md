# Web-Scraping-Bot
This tool allows you to summarize any website by simply providing a link. The tool uses the Beautiful Soup and OpenAI libraries to scrape the website and generate a summary.

The tool works by first scraping the website using Beautiful Soup to extract the main content. The extracted content is then passed to the OpenAI GPT-3 language model, which generates a summary of the website. The summary is then returned to the user.
